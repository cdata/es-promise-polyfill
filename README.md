# ES Promise Polyfill ![Build status for master branch][1]

This project is a stab at creating a reliable, cross-browser polyfill for native platform Promises. The implementation is conformant with [Promises/A+][2]. Currently, the library is run against the [promises-aplus-tests][3] spec. Eventually, it will be fully compatible with [the Promise API documented on HTML5 Rocks][4].
